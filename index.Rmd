**Welcome.**   

We are going to teaching you how to code along with a reproducible, collaborative workflow. 

There are a many fantastic coding and teaching resources that these materials borrow from:

- R for Data Science: Wickham and Grolemund
- Jenny Bryan
- SWC
- DC
- etc, with links.

All open source.


**This training program is under active development and testing** 

This is going to be fun. Learning to code is empowering... This 2-day workshop will teach what we use for the OHI, as described in our nature paper. It will teach you skills and a workflows that you can use in any research and analysis.

Make sure you read \@ref(overview). 

Suggested breakdown for a 2-day workshop: 

|time       |      Day 1|      Day 2|

|9-10:30    |  Motivation, R and RStudio|  more analysis with RMarkdown|
|break      |  | |
|11-12:30   | GitHub, scripting in R|  more analysis with RMarkdown|
|lunch      |  ||
|13:30-15:00 |  analysis: visualization| collaboration with GitHub|
