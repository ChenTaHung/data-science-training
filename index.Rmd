# Welcome {#welcome}

**Welcome.**   **This training program is under active development and testing**.

This 2-day training workshop will introduce you to open data science and get you started working with data in an open, reproducible, and collaborative way. Open data science means science that others can access and reuse without much fuss because all methods, data, and code are available and well-communicated. You will learn a workflow with R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub, as we describe in [Lowndes *et al.* 2017: *Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160).

This is going to be fun; learning open data science tools and practices is empowering! This training book is written so you can use it as self-paced learning, or it can be used to teach an in-person workshop. Either way, you will have your computer as you learn so that you can do everything yourself hands-on. 

Before you begin, be sure you are all set up: see  Chapter \@ref(overview): Overview and Prerequisites.
