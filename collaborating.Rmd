# Collaborating with GitHub {#collaborating}

## Overview

The collaborative power of GitHub and RStudio is really game changing. So far we've been collaborating with our most important collaborator: ourselves. But, we are lucky that in science we have so many other collaborators, so let's learn how to use GitHub with one of them. 

We are going to teach you the simplest way to collaborate with someone, which is for both of you to have administration privileges. GitHub is built for software developer teams, and there is a lot of features that we as scientists won't use immediately. 

We will do this all with a partner, and you'll work pretty independently, with us providing help as you go. 

**Objectives**

- create a new repo and give permission to a collaborator
- open as a new RStudio project!
- collaborate with a partner, explore github.com blame, history
- practice more ggplot2 collab

1. add their neighbor as a collaborator to their repo
1. practice more; make changes to their repo, and to their neighbor's. 

**Resources**


## create gh-pages repo 

You'll be working with the person sitting next to you here. On their computer, create a repository with a gh-pages branch. A reminder from Chapter \@ref(github): [Create a repository on Github.com]

## give your collaborator administration priviledges

Now, go into Settings > Collaborators > enter your collaborator's username. 

Your collaborator then needs to check their email and accept as a collaborator. Notice that your collborator has "Push access to the repository" (highlighted below):

## Clone to a new Rproject

Once your collaborator accepts, you can both clone the repository to your local computer. We'll do this through RStudio like we did before (see Chapter \@ref(github): [Clone your repository using RStudio]), but with a final additional step before hitting "Create Project": select "Open in a new Session".

Opening this Project in a new Session opens up a new world of awesomeness from RStudio. Having different RStudio project sessions allows you to keep your work separate and organized. So you can collaborate with your collaborator on this repository while also working on your other repository from this morning. I tend to have a lot of projects going at one time:

## Collaborative analysis

Now that you both have the same repo cloned to your computers, let's start collaborating. We'll be playing around with the starwars dataset, so let's get setup a bit. 

1. Person 1: update the README to say something about you two, the authors.
1. Person 2: create an RMarkdown file, add something about the authors, and knit it. 
1. Both of you: sync to GitHub.com (pull, stage, commit, push). 
1. Both of you: once you've both synced (talk to each other about it!), pull again. You should see each others' work on your computer.
1. Person 1: in the RMarkdown file, add a bit of the plan. We'll be exploring the `starwars` dataset. 
1. Person 2: in the README, add a bit of the plan. 
1. Both of you: sync

## Explore on GitHub.com

Now, let's look at the repo again on GitHub.com. You'll see those new files appear, and the commit history has increased.

### Commit History

You'll see that the number of commits for the repo has increased, let's have a look. You can see the history of both of you. 

### Blame

Now let's look at a single file, starting with the README file. We've explored the "Raw" and "History" options in the top-right of the file, but we haven't really explored the "Blame" option. Let's look now. Blame shows you line-by-line who authored the most recent version of the file you see. This is super useful if you're trying to understand logic; you know who to ask for questions or attribute credit.

### Issues

Now let's have a look at issues. This is a way you can communicate to others about plans for the repo, questions, etc. Note that issues are public if the repository is public.

![](img/github-issues.png)

Let's create a new issue with the title "NYC flights". 

In the text box, let's write a note to our collaborator. You can use Markdown in this text box, which means all of your header and bullet formatting will come through. You can also select these options by clicking them just above the text box. 

Let's write something here. I'm going to write: 

```
Hi @jafflerbach! 

# first priority

- explore NYC flights
- plot interesting things
```

Note that I have my collaborator's GitHub name with a `@` symbol. This is going to email her directly so that she sees this issue. I can click the "Preview" button at the top left of the text box to see how this will look rendered in Markdown. It looks good! 

Now let's click submit new issue. 

On the right side, there are a bunch of options for categorizing and organizing your issues. You and your collaborator may want to make some labels and timelines, depending on the project. 

Another feature about issues is whether you want any notifications to this repository. Click where it says "Unwatch" up at the top. You'll see three options: "Not watching", "Watching", and "Ignoring". By default, you are watching these issues because you are a collaborator to the repository. But if you stop being a big contributor to this project, you may want to switch to "Not watching". Or, you may want to ask an outside person to watch the issues. Or you may want to watch another repo yourself!

## Your turn

For the rest of this lesson, you're going to be working with your collaborator, syncing to GitHub often and practicing what we've learned so far. We will get started 

Here's what we'll be doing (from [R for Data Science's Transform Chapter](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html)):

**Data**: You will be exploring a dataset on flights departing New York City in 2013. These data are actually in a package called `nycflights13`, so we can load them the way we would any other package.
