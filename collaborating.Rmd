# Collaborating with GitHub {#collaborating}

## Overview

The collaborative power of GitHub and RStudio is really game changing. So far we've been collaborating with our most important collaborator: ourselves. But, we are lucky that in science we have so many other collaborators, so let's learn how to use GitHub with one of them. 

We are going to teach you the simplest way to collaborate with someone, which is for both of you to have administration privileges. GitHub is built for software developer teams, and there is a lot of features that we as scientists won't use immediately. 

We will do this all with a partner, and you'll work pretty independently, with us providing help as you go. 

**Objectives**

- create a new repo and give permission to a collaborator
- open as a new RStudio project!
- collaborate with a partner, explore github.com blame, history
- practice more ggplot2 collab

1. add their neighbor as a collaborator to their repo
1. practice more; make changes to their repo, and to their neighbor's. 

**Resources**


## create gh-pages repo 

You'll be working with the person sitting next to you here. On their computer, create a repository with a gh-pages branch. A reminder from Chapter \@ref(github): [Create a repository on Github.com]

## give your collaborator administration priviledges

Now, go into Settings > Collaborators > enter your collaborator's username. 

Your collaborator then needs to check their email and accept as a collaborator. Notice that your collborator has "Push access to the repository" (highlighted below):

## Clone to a new Rproject

Once your collaborator accepts, you can both clone the repository to your local computer. We'll do this through RStudio like we did before (see Chapter \@ref(github): [Clone your repository using RStudio]), but with a final additional step before hitting "Create Project": select "Open in a new Session".

Opening this Project in a new Session opens up a new world of awesomeness from RStudio. Having different RStudio project sessions allows you to keep your work separate and organized. So you can collaborate with your collaborator on this repository while also working on your other repository from this morning. I tend to have a lot of projects going at one time:

### RStudio projects (.Rproj)

Follow the steps for cloning that we did before, but when you get to a critical point, click open in another project

TODO: RStudio project! Yes, you can use these without Git, but you probably never will, so that's why we're learning it together.
