## Welcome 

This is going to be fun and empowering. Code of conduct. You are all welcome here. Please tell me if it's ever not. 

Everyone is coming from a different place with different experiences. Stickies. 
You are all welcome here and encouraged to help each other. 

## Collaboration

- First, with you. If you don't think you collaborate, you might not be doing science. Future you. 
- Then, with your lab and and collaborators. 
- And, with collaborators that don't yet exist. 

## Reproducibility

- record of your analyses. 
- rerun them!
- modify them, maybe change a threshold, try a different coefficient, etc, maybe today
- modify them, make a new figure, in 6 months! 


## Mindset

- stop confounding data science with your science. Expect that someone has had your problem before or done what you want to do.
