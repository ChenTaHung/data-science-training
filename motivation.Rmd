## Welcome 

This is going to be fun and empowering. Code of conduct. You are all welcome here. Please tell me if it's ever not. 

Everyone is coming from a different place with different experiences. Stickies. 
You are all welcome here and encouraged to help each other. 

## Collaboration

- First, with you. If you don't think you collaborate, you might not be doing science. Future you. 
- Then, with your lab and and collaborators. 
- And, with collaborators that don't yet exist. 

## Reproducibility

- record of your analyses. 
- rerun them!
- modify them, maybe change a threshold, try a different coefficient, etc, maybe today
- modify them, make a new figure, in 6 months! 


## Mindset


New but will become increasingly familiar. We’ll start you off with some momentum, like if you were going to learn to ride a bike or ...

Expect that there is a way to do what you want to do

- stop confounding data science with your science. Expect that someone has had your problem before or done what you want to do. 


<!---If you plan to program mostly in one particular language on a single platform (such as Mac or Windows), you might try an integrated development environment (IDE). IDEs integrate text editing, syntax highlighting, version control, help, build tools, and debugging in one interface, simplifying development.

## Data science is a discipline

It has theories, methods, and tools. 

Tidyverse and Hadley’s graphic. Tidy data.

Going to teach you how to think differently, get into some of the theory but in the context of hands-on work.
