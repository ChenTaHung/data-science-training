## Overview

Now you have some experience wrangling and working with tidy data. But we all know that not all data that you have are tidy. So how do we make data more tidy? With the `tidyr` package. 

**Objectives**

- learn `tidyr` with the `gapminder` package
- other wrangling: joins, binding
- practice the RStudio-GitHub workflow
- your turn: use the data wrangling cheat sheet to explore window functions


**Resources**

These materials borrow heavily from: 

- [R for Data Science: Relational Data](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data)
- [R for Data Science: Tidy Data](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#spreading-and-gathering)


### Setup

We'll work today in RMarkdown. You can either continue from the same RMarkdown as yesterday, or begin a new one. 

**Here's what to do:**

1. Clear your workspace (Session > Restart R)
1. New File > R Markdown..., save as something other than `gapminder-wrangle.Rmd` and delete irrelevant info, or just continue using `gapminder-wrangle.Rmd`

I'm going to write this in my R Markdown file:

```
Data wrangling with `tidyr`, which is part of the tidyverse. We are going to tidy some data!
```

## Finishing up dplyr

## Joining datasets 

Sometimes you have data coming from different places or in different files, and you want to put them together so you can analyze them. This is called relational data, because it has some kind of relationship. In the tidyverse, combining data that has a relationship is called "joining". 

From the [RStudio cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf) (note: this is an earlier version of the cheatsheet but I like the graphics):

![](img/rstudio-cheatsheet-combine.png)

Notice how you may not have exactly the same observations in the x1 columns above. Observations A and B are the same, but notice how the table on the left has observation C, and the table on the right has observation D. 

If you wanted to combine these two tables, how would you do it? There are some decisions you'd have to make about what was important to you. The cheatsheet visualizes it for us:

![](img/rstudio-cheatsheet-combine-options.png)

We will just talk about this briefly here, but you can refer to this more as you have your own datasets that you want to join. This describes the figure above::

- `left_join` keeps everything from the left table and matches as much as it can from the right table. In R, the first thing that you type will be the left table (because it's on the left)
- `right_join` keeps everything from the right table and matches as much as it can from the left table
- `inner_join` only keeps the observations that are similar between the two tables
- `full_join` keeps all observations from both tables. 

These are all "mutating joins" because they add another column to what had been there previously. There are also "filtering joins" that do not add another column: 

- `semi_join` keeps only the observations that are in both tables
- `anti_join` keeps only the observations that are NOT in both tables.

Let's play with [these](http://edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/news_docs/CO2_1970-2014_dataset_of_CO2_report_2015.xls) CO2 emmissions data just to illustrate:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

## read in the data. (same URL as yesterday, just with co2.csv instead of gapminder.csv)
co2 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/co2.csv")

## explore
co2 %>% head()
co2 %>% dim() # 220

## new variable to 
gap_2007 <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 2007)
gap_2007 %>% dim() # 142  

## left join gap_2007 to co2
g <- left_join(gap_2007, co2, by = "country")


y <- intersect(gap_2007 %>% select(country), 
          co2 %>% select(country))

keep <- left_join(x, y)

g <- left_join(gap_2007, keep, by = "country") 
g %>% dim() #142
g %>% summary()

h <- right_join(gap_2007, keep, by = "country")
h %>% dim() # 220
h %>% summary()


```




There are three families of verbs designed to work with relational data:

- Mutating joins, which add new variables to one data frame from matching observations in another.

- Filtering joins, which filter observations from one data frame based on whether or not they match an observation in the other table.

- Set operations, which treat observations as if they were set elements.



We are going to `left_join()` the gapminder data with the estimated data. Left joining the gapminder data will keep all the information in gapminder, but with additional information from the estimated data. So gapminder doesn't lose any rows. 

Let's have a look:
```{r}
## to check:
str(gapminder) # 1704 observations of 6 variables

gapminder_est <- gapminder %>%
  left_join(countries_estimated, 
            by = "country")

str(gapminder_est) #1704 obs. of  7 variables
head(gapminder_est, 20)
```

So `left_join()`ing added a 7th column to our data, and if we have a look at it (`head()`), you can see that the yes's and no's from the estimated data have been repeated. 

Great! Now we are going to continue with our analysis. We want to label our plots  differently if they are based on estimated data. This means that when we go through our for loop, we want to conditionally plot them. 



### load `tidyverse` (which has `tidyr` inside)

First load `tidyr` in an R chunk. You already have installed the tidyverse, so you should be able to just load it like this (using the comment so you can run `install.packages("tidyverse")` easily if need be):

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=F}
library(tidyverse) # install.packages("tidyverse")
```


## `tidyr` basics

Remember, from the **`dplyr`** section, that tidy data means all rows are an observation and all columns are variables.
![](img/tidy_data.png)

It's important to recognize what *shape* your data is in, and work towards tidying it up.

Let's take a look at some examples.

Data in the *wide* format each row is often a site/subject/patient and you have multiple observation variables containing the same type of data. These can be either repeated observations over time, or observation of multiple variables (or a mix of both). Data input may be simpler or some other applications may prefer the *wide* format. However, many of `R`'s functions have been designed assuming you have *long* format data. 

A simple example of data in a *wide* format is the `AirPassengers` dataset which provides information on monthly airline passenger numbers from 1949-1960. You'll notice that each row is a single year and the columns are each month Jan - Dec. 

```{r wide_data_ex}
AirPassengers
```

*long* format is the tidy data we are after, where:

 - each column is a variable
 - each row is an observation

In the *long* format, you usually have 1 column for the observed variable and the other columns are ID variables. The `mpg` dataset is an example of a *long* dataset with each row representing a single car and each column representing a variable of that car such as `manufacturer` and `year`.

```{r long_data_ex}
mpg
```

<br> 

These different data formats mainly affect readability. For humans, the wide format is often more intuitive since we can often see more of the data on the screen due to it's shape. However, the long format is more machine readable and is closer to the formatting of databases. The ID variables in our dataframes are similar to the fields in a database and observed variables are like the database values.

**Note:** Generally, mathematical operations are better in long format, although some plotting functions actually work better with wide format.

Often, data must be reshaped for it to become tidy data. What does that mean? There are four main verbs we'll use, which are essentially pairs of opposites:

- turn columns into rows (`gather()`),
- turn rows into columns (`spread()`),
- turn a character column into multiple columns (`separate()`),
- turn multiple character columns into a single column (`unite()`)

## Explore gapminder dataset.

Yesterday we started off with the gapminder data in a format that was already tidy. But what if it weren't? Let's look at a different version of those data. 


The data are on GitHub. Navigate there by going to: 

github.com > ohi-science > data-science-training > data > gapminder_wide.csv

or by copy-pasting this in the browser: `https://github.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/blob/master/data/gapminder_wide.csv`

Have a look at the data. 

> Question: Is gapminder a purely long, purely wide, or some intermediate format?

You can see there are a lot more columns than the version we looked at before. This format is pretty common, because it can be a lot more intuitive to *enter* data in this way.

![](img/gapminder_wide_gh.png)

<br>

Sometimes, as with the gapminder dataset, we have multiple types of observed data. It is somewhere in between the purely 'long' and 'wide' data formats: 

- 3 "ID variables" (`continent`, `country`, `year`) 
- 3 "Observation variables" (`pop`,`lifeExp`,`gdpPercap`). 

It's pretty common to have data in this intermediate format in most cases despite not having ALL observations in 1 column, since all 3 observation variables have different units. But we can play with switching it to long format and wide to show what that means (i.e. long would be 4 ID variables and 1 observation variable).


But we want it to be in a tidy way so that we can work with it more easily. So here we go. 

You use `spread()` and `gather()` to transform or reshape data between *wide* to *long* formats.

## `gather()` data from wide to long format

`r img(src='img/rstudio-cheatsheet-reshaping-data-gather.png', width=500)` 

<br>

Read in the data from GitHub. Remember, you need to click on the 'Raw' button first so you can read it directly. Let's also read in the gapminder data from yesterday so that we can use it to compare later on. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## wide format
gap_wide <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/gapminder_wide.csv')

## yesterday's format (intermediate)
gapminder <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/gapminder.csv')
```

Let's have a look:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(gap_wide)
str(gap_wide)
```

While wide format is nice for data entry, it's not nice for calculations. Some of the columns are a mix of variable (e.g. "gdpPercap") and data ("1952").  What if you were asked for the mean population after 1990 in Algeria? Possible, but ugly. But we know it doesn't need to be so ugly. Let's tidy it back to the format we've been using. 

> Question: let's talk this through together. If we're trying to turn the `gap_wide` format into `gapminder` format, what structure does it have that we like? And what do we want to change?

- We like the continent and country columns. We won't want to change those. 
- For long format, we'd want just 1 column identifying the variable name (`tidyr` calls this a **'key'**), and 1 column for the data (`tidyr` calls this the '**value'**).
- For intermediate format, we'd want 3 columns for `gdpPercap`, `lifeExp`, and `pop`.
- We would like year as a separate column. 

Let's get it to long format. We'll have to do this in 2 steps. The first step is to take all of those column names (e.g. `lifeExp_1970`) and make them a variable in a new column, and transfer the values into another column. Let's learn by doing:

Let's have a look at `gather()`'s help: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
?gather
```

> Question: What is our **key-value pair**? 

We need to name two new variables in the key-value pair, one for the key, one for the value. It can be hard to wrap your mind around this, so let's give it a try. Let's name them `obstype_year` and `obs_values`.  

Here's the start of what we'll do: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
gap_long <- gap_wide %>% 
  gather(key   = obstype_year,
         value = obs_values)
```

<!--- I (Jamie) did not get a warning message--->
We got a warning message. This means that `gather()` worked, but maybe not how we wanted it to. 

Although we were already planning to inspect our work, let's definitely do it now:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
str(gap_long)
head(gap_long)
tail(gap_long)
```

We have reshaped our dataframe but this new format isn't necessarily what we wanted. It's important to check, and listen to that warning message--dropping attributes seems very suspicious. 

<!---again, I did not get a warning message ^ so please double check---> 

What went wrong? Notice that it didn't know that we wanted to keep `continent` and `country` untouched; we need to give it more information about which columns we want reshaped. We can do this in several ways.

One way is to identify the columns by name. Listing them explicitly can be a good approach if there are just a few. But in our case we have 30 columns. I'm not going to list them out here since there is way too much potential for error if I tried to list `gdpPercap_1952`, `gdpPercap_1957`, `gdpPercap_1962` and so on. But we could use some of `dplyr`'s awesome helper functions — because we expect that there is a better way to do this!

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gap_long <- gap_wide %>% 
  gather(key   = obstype_year,
         value = obs_values,
         dplyr::starts_with('pop'),
         dplyr::starts_with('lifeExp'),
         dplyr::starts_with('gdpPercap'))

str(gap_long)
head(gap_long)
tail(gap_long)
```

Success! And there is another way that is nice to use if your columns don't follow such a structured pattern: you can exclude the columns you *don't* want. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gap_long <- gap_wide %>% 
  gather(key   = obstype_year,
         value = obs_values,
         -continent, -country)

str(gap_long)
head(gap_long)
tail(gap_long)
```

To recap: 

Inside `gather()` we first name the new column for the new ID variable (`obstype_year`), the name for the new amalgamated observation variable (`obs_value`), then the names of the old observation variable. We could have typed out all the observation variables, but as in the `select()` function (see `dplyr` lesson), we can use the `starts_with()` argument to select all variables that starts with the desired character string. Gather also allows the alternative syntax of using the `-` symbol to identify which variables are not to be gathered (i.e. ID variables).


OK, but we're not done yet. `obstype_year` actually contains two pieces of information, the observation type (`pop`,`lifeExp`, or `gdpPercap`) and the `year`. We can use the `separate()` function to split the character strings into multiple variables.

`?separate` --> the main arguments are `separate(data, col, into, sep ...)`. So we need to specify which column we want separated, name the new columns that we want to create, and specify what we want it to separate by. Since the `obstype_year` variable has observation types and years separated by a `_`, we'll use that. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gap_long <- gap_wide %>% 
  gather(key   = obstype_year,
         value = obs_values,
         -continent, -country) %>%
  separate(obstype_year,
           into = c('obs_type','year'),
           sep = "_",
           convert = T) #this ensures that the year column is an integer rather than a character
``` 

No warning messages...still we inspect:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
str(gap_long)
head(gap_long)
tail(gap_long)
```
Excellent. This is long format: every row is a unique observation. Yay!

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# solution (no peeking!)
gap_long %>% 
  group_by(continent, obs_type) %>%
    summarize(means = mean(obs_values))

```
## Plot long format data

The long format is the preferred format for plotting with `ggplot2`. Let's look at an example by plotting just Canada's life expectency.

```{r, eval=F}
canada_df <- gap_long %>%
  filter(obs_type == "lifeExp",
         country == "Canada")

ggplot(canada_df, aes(x = year, y = obs_values)) +
  geom_line()
```

We can also look at all countries in the Americas:

```{r,eval=F}
life_df <- gap_long %>%
  filter(obs_type == "lifeExp",
         continent == "Americas")

ggplot(life_df, aes(x = year, y = obs_values, color = country)) +
  geom_line()

```

## `spread()` 

The function `spread()` is used to transform data from long to intermediate format

Alright! Now just to double-check our work, let's use the opposite of `gather()` to spread our observation variables back to the original format with the aptly named `spread()`. You pass `spread()` the key and value pair, which is now `obs_type` and `obs_values`.

![](img/rstudio-cheatsheet-reshaping-data-spread.png)


```{r, eval=FALSE}
gap_normal <- gap_long %>% 
  spread(obs_type, obs_values)
```

No warning messages is good...but still let's check:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
dim(gap_normal)
dim(gapminder)
names(gap_normal)
names(gapminder)
```

Now we've got an intermediate dataframe `gap_normal` with the same dimensions as the original `gapminder`, but the order of the variables is different. Let's fix that before checking if they are `all.equal()`.

> ### Exercise
>
> Reorder the columns in "gap_normal" to match "gapminder". 
>

#### Answer (no peeking!)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# one way with dplyr and %>%
gap_normal <- gap_normal %>%
  select(country, continent, year, lifeExp, pop, gdpPercap)

# another way with base R
gap_normal <- gap_normal[,names(gapminder)]
```

Now let's check if they are all.equal (`?all.equal`) is a handy test
```{r, eval=FALSE}
all.equal(gap_normal, gapminder)
```

Hooray!

```{r, eval=FALSE}
str(gap_normal)
str(gapminder)
```


(In the past, mine has shown a slight difference because one is a data.frame and one is a tbl_df, which is similar to a data.frame. We won't get into this difference now, I'm feeling good about these data sets! We've gone from the longest format back to the intermediate and we didn't introduce any errors in our code.)

> ### Exercise

>1. Convert "gap_long" all the way back to gap_wide. Hint: you'll need to create appropriate labels for all our new variables (time*metric combinations) with the opposite of separate: `tidyr::unite()`.

### Answer (no peeking)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(gap_long) # remember the columns

gap_wide_new <- gap_long %>% 
  # first unite obs_type and year into a new column called var_names. Separate by _
  unite(col = var_names, obs_type, year, sep = "_") %>% 
  # then spread var_names out by key-value pair.
  spread(key = var_names, value = obs_values)
str(gap_wide_new)
```

## clean up and save your .Rmd 

Spend some time cleaning up and saving `gapminder-wrangle.Rmd`
Restart R. In RStudio, use *Session > Restart R*. Otherwise, quit R with `q()` and re-launch it.

This morning's .Rmd could look something like this: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}

## load tidyr (in tidyverse)
library(tidyverse) # install.packages("tidyverse")

## load wide data
gap_wide <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/gapminder_wide.csv')

head(gap_wide)
str(gap_wide)

## practice tidyr::gather() wide to long
gap_long <- gap_wide %>% 
  gather(key   = obstype_year,
         value = obs_values,
         -continent, -country) 
# or 
gap_long <- gap_wide %>% 
  gather(key   = obstype_year,
         value = obs_values,
         dplyr::starts_with('pop'),
         dplyr::starts_with('lifeExp'),
         dplyr::starts_with('gdpPercap'))

## gather() and separate() to create our original gapminder
gap_long <- gap_wide %>% 
  gather(key   = obstype_year,
         value = obs_values,
         -continent, -country) %>%
  separate(obstype_year,
           into = c('obs_type','year'),
           sep="_")

## practice: can still do calculations in long format
gap_long %>% 
  group_by(continent, obs_type) %>%
  summarize(means = mean(obs_values))

## spread() from normal to wide
gap_normal <- gap_long %>% 
  spread(obs_type, obs_values) %>%
  select(country, continent, year, lifeExp, pop, gdpPercap)

## check that all.equal()
all.equal(gap_normal,gapminder)

## unite() and spread(): convert gap_long to gap_wide
head(gap_long) # remember the columns

gap_wide_new <- gap_long %>% 
  # first unite obs_type and year into a new column called var_names. Separate by _
  unite(col = var_names, obs_type, year, sep = "_") %>% 
  # then spread var_names out by key-value pair.
  spread(key = var_names, value = obs_values)
str(gap_wide_new)
```

### `complete()`

One of the coolest functions in `tidyr` is the function `complete()`. Jarrett Byrnes has written up a [great blog piece]((http://www.imachordata.com/you-complete-me/)) showcasing the utility of this function so I'm going to use that example here.

We'll start with an example dataframe where the data recorder enters the Abundance of two species of kelp, *Saccharina* and *Agarum* in the years 1999, 2000 and 2004.
```{r, eval=F}
kelpdf <- data.frame(
  Year = c(1999, 2000, 2004, 1999, 2004),
  Taxon = c("Saccharina", "Saccharina", "Saccharina", "Agarum", "Agarum"),
  Abundance = c(4,5,2,1,8)
)

kelpdf
```

Jarrett points out that *Agarum* is not listed for the year 2000. Does this mean it wasn't observed (Abundance = 0) or that it wasn't recorded (Abundance = NA)? Only the person who recorded the data knows, but let's assume that the this means the Abundance was 0 for that year. 

We can use the `complete()` function to make our dataset more complete.

```{r, eval=F}
kelpdf %>% complete(Year, Taxon)
```

This gives us an NA for *Agarum* in 2000, but we want it to be a 0 instead. We can use the `fill` argument to assign the fill value.
```{r, eval=F}
kelpdf %>% complete(Year, Taxon, fill = list(Abundance = 0))
```

Now we have what we want. Let's assume that all years between 1999 and 2004 that aren't listed should actually be assigned a value of 0. We can use the `full_seq()` function from `tidyr` to fill out our dataset with all years 1999-2004 and assign Abundance values of 0 to those years & species for which there was no observation.

```{r, eval=F}

kelpdf %>% complete(Year = full_seq(Year, period = 1),
                   Taxon,
                   fill = list(Abundance = 0))
```
