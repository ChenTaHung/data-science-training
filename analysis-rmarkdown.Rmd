See [Mastering Markdown · GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and add some more personalized content to the README of your own, like a bulleted list or blockquote.
For on the fly rendering, the [atom](https://atom.io/) text editor is good.


## Intro to Markdown


### from GitHub.com

Let's learn markdown by editing the `README.md` on github.com for convenience. A README.md file can be added to every folder in a repository, and they are automatically displayed when the repository is opened on github.com  

The `README.md` is in **markdown**, simple syntax for conversion to HTML. `.md` is a kind of text file, so you only need a text editor to read it. If you were editing this on your computer, you could do this right in RStudio, which has a built-in text editor. (You could also do it in another text editor program, but RStudio is convenient). Copy-paste the following into your `README.md`: 
  
```
# my-project

This project is based on [Collaborative, Reproducible Science training ](https://ohi-science.org/data-science-training/).

## Introduction

Markdown syntax changes plain text to **bold** and *italics*:

1. **Git**
1. **Github**
1. *Markdown*
1. *Rmarkdown*

## Conclusion

```

Notice the syntax for:


- **headers** get rendered at multiple levels: `#`, `##`
- **link**: `[](http://...)`
- **image**: `![](http://...)` — note the `!`
- *italics*: `*word*` 
- **bold**: `**word**`
- **numbered list** gets automatically sequenced: `1.`, `1.`

### from RStudio

Let's go back to RStudio. Pull so that you have the most recent version of your README locally. Let's open it and have a look. Documentation is a really important part of coding, so let's look at the README. If we look at GitHub.com, you can see that the README is displayed nicely like online. Let's add some more description about what our GitHub repository is for. 
    
Now click on the Preview button to see the markdown rendered as HTML.

Let's change the image to the plot we made yesterday. 

`![](my_plot.png)`
    

There are some good [cheatsheets](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) to get you started, and here is one built into RStudio:

knit with the button; also `knitr`

### Your turn

Update the README, push to GitHub



## RMarkdown from RStudio

Back in RStudio, let's create a new RMarkdown file, which allows us to weave markdown text with chunks of R code to be evaluated and output content like tables and plots.

File -> New File -> RMarkdown... -> Document of output format HTML, OK.

`r img(src='img/rstudio_new-rmd-doc-html.png', width=300)`

You can give it a Title of "My Project". After you click OK, most importantly File -> Save as `index` (which will get named with the filename extension `index.Rmd`).

Some initial text is already provided for you. Let's go ahead and "Knit HTML".

Notice how the markdown is rendered similar to as before + **R code chunks** are surrounded by 3 backticks and `{r LABEL}`. These are evaluated and return the output text in the case of `summary(cars)` and the output plot in the case of `plot(pressure)`.

Notice how the code `plot(pressure)` is not shown in the HTML output because of the R code chunk option `echo=FALSE`.

**Before we continue exploring Rmarkdown**, let's sync this the .rmd and .html to github.com. Enter a message like "added index" and click on "Commit and Sync gh-pages". This will update <https://github.com/USER/my-project>, and now you can also see your project website with a default `index.html` viewable at <http://USER.github.io/my-project>
