# Overview and Prerequisites {#overview}

This is a 2-day bootcamp for hands-on learning of R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub, and will teach reproducible workflows that can be used in analyses of all kinds, including Ocean Health Index assessments. 

- you'll learn 3 broad tools all at the same time: coding in R/RStudio, collaborative version control with Git/GitHub, and communication/publishing with markdown/GitHub. All at the same time because that's how you'll work in reality. I made all of these training materials with these tools.

2-day workshop, split into 4 primary topics. Table of morning, afternoon, day 1, day 2. These materials can be used to teach this 2-day bootcamp, or can be used as a self-paced course

We’ll start with data viz, and then will start using GitHub for reproducible workflows on Day 1. Then on day 2 we’ll continue to use GitHub with RStudio as a way to practice as we learn.

More often than not, there are more than one way to do things. I'm going to focus mostly on what I have ended up using day-to-day; I try to incorporate better practices as I come upon them but that's not always the case. RStudio has some built-in redundancy too that I'll try to show you so that you can approach things in different ways and ease in.

- based on literature: best and good enough practices
- also based on our team's experience of how to do better science in less time

## Prerequisites

R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub are freely available and open-source, meaning that anyone can download...


## Credit

This material builds from a lot of materials developed by others. In particular, it pulls from the following resources, which are excellent and highly recommended for further learning and as resources later on: 

- [R for Data Science]
- [STAT 545]
- [Software Carpentry]
- [Happy Git with R]
