# Overview and Prerequisites {#overview}

This is a 2-day training workshop to learn R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub. You will learn a reproducible workflow that can be used in analyses of all kinds, including Ocean Health Index assessments. This is really powerful, cool stuff, and not just for data: I made and published this book using those four tools and workflow.

We will practice learning three main things all at the same time: coding with best practices (R/RStudio), collaborative version control (Git/GitHub), and communication/publishing (R markdown/GitHub). This training will teach these all together to reinforce skills and best practices, and get you comfortable with a workflow that you can use in your own projects. 

<!---
More often than not, there are more than one way to do things. I'm going to focus mostly on what I have ended up using day-to-day; I try to incorporate better practices as I come upon them but that's not always the case. RStudio has some built-in redundancy too that I'll try to show you so that you can approach things in different ways and ease in.

- based on literature: best and good enough practices
- also based on our team's experience of how to do better science in less time

## Prerequisites

Before the training, please make sure you have done the following: 

1. Have up-to-date versions of `R` and RStudio and have RStudio configured with Git/GitHub 
    - Download and install R: https://cloud.r-project.org
    - Download and install RStudio: http://www.rstudio.com/download 
    - Create a GitHub account: https://github.com *Note! Shorter names that kind of identify you are better, and use your work email!*
1. Get comfortable: if you're not in a physical workshop, be set up with two screens if possible. You will be following along in RStudio on your own computer while also watching a virtual training or following this tutorial on your own.
